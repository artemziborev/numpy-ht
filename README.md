# numpy-ht

## Overview
`numpy-ht` is a Python-based project designed to provide utilities and machine learning functionalities, leveraging the capabilities of the NumPy library. The project includes custom implementations of gradient checking, classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression), and utility modules.

## Features
- **Gradient Checker:** A module to verify gradients in machine learning models.
- **Logistic Regression Classifier:** A simple implementation of logistic regression.
- **Utility Functions:** General-purpose functions to support development.
